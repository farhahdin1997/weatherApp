<h1>Weather App</h1>
<br>

This project is a weather dashboard application with search feature that allows users to look up current weather conditions and forecasts for many cities. I have used momentjs() to allow users to see the current date. I have used open weather api to allow users to view weather data and jQurey. Bootstrap has also been implemented into this page to allow the web page to be responsive. 



## User Story

```
As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly

```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
